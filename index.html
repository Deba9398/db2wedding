                    <p>2019 marks the seventh year which we have been together. In those 7 years, we have shared so many different life experiences. It’s strange to look back and see how our lives have changed from being friends in High School, to dating throughout College, to finally navigating the complexities of starting careers. Now, as our wedding approaches, we get to look to the future and all the exciting new experiences to come. We are so happy to share this day with the people we love and we can’t wait to see what comes next!</p>
                    <p>Love,</p>
                    <p>Dana and Derek</p>

                    <h3>High Altitude Warning</h3>
                    <p>Vail Village sits at 8,500 ft above sea level. At that height there is ~25% less oxygen than at sea level and can result in high altitude sickness. Symptoms are generally minor and can be reduced by slowly acclimating to the rise in elevation by staying one night in Denver before ascending to Vail.</p>
                    <p>It is important to stay hydrated while in Colorado. <a href="https://www.vailgov.com/visiting/high-altitude-health-tips">Vail has a small list of recommendations</a> such as drinking 3 - 4 times more water than you typically do and being careful with diuretics like alcohol and caffeine.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/altitude-increases-sunburn-risk">sunburn risk is high in Vail</a>. Please remember to use sunscreen and to be especially careful if you plan to go to higher elevations.</p>

                    <br />
                    <h3>Weather Warning</h3>
                    <p>Vail's weather can be unpredictable this time of year. On average, the 3rd week of September has a high temp of 70°F and a low of 44°F but it is not unusual to experience snow. Please come prepared for a wide range of weather.</p>

                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Travel</h3>
                    <p>The easiest and likely least expensive option is to fly in to Denver International Airport (DIA) and then rent a car to drive up to Vail. The drive from DIA to Vail is 120 miles and takes about 2 to 3 hours depending on traffic and weather conditions.</p>
                    <p>If you would prefer not to drive, there are two shuttle services that offer a ride directly from DIA to your hotel in Vail: <a href="https://www.epicmountainexpress.com/shuttle-rates">Epic Mountain Express</a> and <a href="https://www.mountainshuttle.com/airport-shuttle-rates/">Peak 1 Express</a>.</p>
